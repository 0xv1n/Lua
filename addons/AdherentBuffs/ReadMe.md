**Description:**  
AdherentBuffs checks your current target.  
If it's one of the Incursion Adherents it will send a message to the preferred chat mode saying the Adherent's job and the buffs it gives to the linked Boss.  
  
If AutoAnnounce is turned on the addon will automatically announce in the selected chat mode whenever you target an Adherent.
It will remember, through mob_id, the Adherents it has already announced, so there won't be any risk of spamming chat with the same Adherent over and over.
This list is temporary and clears up each time you reload the addon, otherwise you can manually clear it by using the specific command
