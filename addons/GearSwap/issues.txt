Issues:
* Need to detect/correct for Encumberment (Pathos), Traded, Dbox'ed, AH Dialog, and Crafting.
* Event status fix. Dead status fix. Zoning status fix.
* Need a Spellcast -> Lua converter before release.
* Need to decide what the heck I'm doing with the second argument to user functions.
* Change mob_array.type so that it matches validtarget.
