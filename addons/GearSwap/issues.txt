Issues:
* Need to detect/correct for Encumberment (Pathos), Charmed status, Traded, Dbox'ed, AH Dialog, and Crafting.
* Need a Spellcast -> Lua converter before release
* Need to check whether require '' works within user documents
* Need to check whether register_event() works within user documents
* Need to remove collect_garbage() calls after confirming that it is unnecessary with the 4.1 hook.
* Need to make a kill switch for GearSwap when the Lua file that is supposed to be loaded is invalid.
* Need to confirm all the variables exist at precast/midcast/aftercast the way that I think they do.
* Need to decide what the heck I'm doing with the second argument to user functions.
* Need to detect when it's not possible to cast (Sleep, Stun, Break, Terror, Charm, etc.) and reset midaction
* Change it so status_change() doesn't fire when you disengage from NPCs.
* Change it so status_change() passes the old/new status in a less nonsensical way.
* Change mob_array.type so that it matches validtarget.
