Issues:
* Need to detect/correct for Encumberment (Pathos), Traded, Dbox'ed, AH Dialog, and Crafting.
* Event status fix. Dead status fix. Zoning status fix.
* Need a Spellcast -> Lua converter before release.
* Need to decide what the heck I'm doing with the second argument to user functions.
* Need to detect when it's not possible to cast (Sleep, Stun, Break, Terror, Charm, etc.) and reset midaction.
* Change mob_array.type so that it matches validtarget.

Elpy section:
* cancel_spell in GearSwap no longer works with Shortcuts loaded. ( http://www.bluegartr.com/threads/115131-Windower-4-Open-Beta?p=5850951&viewfull=1#post5850951 )
