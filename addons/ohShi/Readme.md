Replacement for yarnregex for Windower 4 I made for a friend. Uses the chat log so filters must be off. At least until i figure out another way to do it. Keeps track of various event related things. Such as, VW proc messages, mob casting, mob tp moves, TH procs and cor rolls, as well as others. Digi of shiva created the icon and was the driving force behind testing/giving me the idea to do this. Digi also created the default mob list/danger list and chose the name.

Abbreviation: //ohShi

You have access to the following commands:
 1. ohShi bgcolor <alpha> <red> <green> <blue> --Sets the color of the box.
 2. ohShi text <red> <green> <blue> --Sets text color.
 2. ohShi font <size> <name> --Sets text font and size.
 3. ohShi pos <posx> <posy> --Sets position of box.
 4. ohShi duration <seconds> --Sets the timeout on the notices.
 5. ohShi track <vw/legion/other/abyssea/meebles> <mobname> --Adds mob to the tracking list.
 6. ohShi danger <spell/ws> <dangerword> --Adds danger word to list.
 7. ohShi unload --Save settings and close ohShi.
